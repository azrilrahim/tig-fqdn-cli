    -   Add missing tig.db into repository

    -   Add new outfile feature. Results can be saved into a file
        instead to stdio. function of=?<target_file_name> allows
        user to save the output to designated file.

    -   Correct the logic error input where input can only be
        either fqdn=? or if=?. Any non recognized command inputs
        will be rejected. Previously command line are not validated
        and has caused of logic error that leads to segmented error

    -   Removed a few debug message that pop outs during operations.

    -   Fix open db. Previously open db is executed on loading.
        Now open db is executed after user key in all arguments
        This is to make way to variable db input location that will
